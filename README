A library for sending messages between systems using chat servers. Currently
this only supports IRC (sorta).


CLIENT

The client is like a slow "netcat" connection. It just sends what ever you
type across the wire and prints out what it sees.


TODO

* put debug output in a debug log
* better handle issues with bad connections and network lag
